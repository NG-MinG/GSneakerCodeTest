# G-Sneaker Code Test

My name is Nguyen Duc Minh. I have fully completed the required features of "CODE TEST" with the following sections:

# Requirements

### Must have: Fully completed

-   [x] Display all products in `Our Products` section (for products data please check from [Technical Requirements](#technical-requirements)):
    -   [x] Single product should have name, description, price, image and `Add To Cart` button.
    -   [x] User able to click on `Add To Cart` to add target product to their cart.
    -   [x] Added product doesn't have `Add To Cart` button anymore, it should have `Check Mark Icon (âœ“)` instead.
-   [x] Display all added products in `Your Cart` section:
    -   [x] Each product in cart should have name, price, image, increase/decrease amount button and remove button.
    -   [x] User able to increase/decrease amount of a product in cart. When product's amount is decreased to zero, that product will be removed from cart naturally.
    -   [x] User able to remove product from cart.
    -   [x] Show total price of all products in car. When user increase/decrease product's amount or remove product, total price should be re-calculate correctly.
    -   [x] When there are no products in cart, we should show `Your cart is empty` message.
    -   [x] Products in cart should be persistent: When user visit the application, products are added before should be showed, user don't need to add products again.
